# **Payment Processing System ‚Äì Explanation (Applying SOLID Principles)**

This **payment processing system** supports multiple payment methods ( **Credit Card, PayPal, Google Pay** ) while ensuring **scalability, flexibility, and maintainability** using  **SOLID principles** .

---

## **üìå Overview of the Code**

The system consists of  **multiple classes, each handling a specific responsibility** :

1. **`PaymentService` Interface** ‚Üí Defines a **common contract** for all payment methods.
2. **Payment Implementations (`CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `GooglePayPayment`)** ‚Üí Handle different payment methods.
3. **`PaymentProcessor`** ‚Üí Executes the payment process (authorization & completion).
4. **`PaymentLogger`** ‚Üí Logs transaction details.
5. **`PaymentServiceManager`** ‚Üí Manages payment processing, keeps `main` method clean.
6. **`main` Method** ‚Üí Simply triggers payment processing.

1Ô∏è‚É£ `PaymentService` Interface (OCP, ISP)

‚úî **Open for Extension (OCP)** ‚Äì New payment methods can be added  **without modifying existing code** .
‚úî **Interface Segregation (ISP)** ‚Äì The interface **only** defines relevant payment-related methods.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Implementations (LSP)

‚úî **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ‚Äì `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and `GooglePayPayment` **can replace `PaymentService`** without breaking the system.

3Ô∏è‚É£ `PaymentProcessor` (DIP, SRP)

‚úî **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** ‚Äì `PaymentProcessor` **depends on an abstraction (`PaymentService`)** instead of concrete classes.
‚úî **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚Äì It **only** handles the payment process,  **not logging or user input** .

4Ô∏è‚É£ `PaymentLogger` (SRP)

‚úî **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** ‚Äì This class  **only logs transactions** , keeping logging **separate** from payment processing.

5Ô∏è‚É£ `PaymentServiceManager` (Manages the Payment Flow)

‚úî **Keeps `main` method clean.**
‚úî **Manages both processing and logging in a structured way.**
‚úî **If more functionality (like refunds) is needed, we add it here‚Äîwithout modifying `main`!**

## **‚úÖ How Each SOLID Principle is Applied**

| **SOLID Principle**                       | **How It Is Applied in This System**                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** | `PaymentProcessor` handles only execution,`PaymentLogger` handles logging,`PaymentServiceManager` manages operations.               |
| **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**           | New payment methods (e.g.,`PaytmPayment`) can be added **without modifying existing code** .                                      |
| **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)**   | `CreditCardPayment`,`PayPalPayment`, and `GooglePayPayment`  **can replace `PaymentService` without breaking the system** . |
| **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)** | `PaymentService` **only**defines necessary methods, so classes don‚Äôt have to implement unnecessary ones.                         |
| **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**  | `PaymentProcessor` depends on `PaymentService` (an abstraction), **not concrete classes** .                                     |

## **Final Benefits of This Design**

‚úî **Modular & Maintainable** ‚Äì Easy to add new payment types  **without modifying existing classes** .
‚úî **Flexible & Extensible** ‚Äì We can extend functionality (e.g., refunds, multiple currencies)  **without breaking the system** .
‚úî **Testable & Scalable** ‚Äì Each class can be  **tested separately** , making debugging easier.
‚úî **Adheres to Best Practices** ‚Äì The  **`main` method is clean** , and concerns are well-separated.

üíØ **This design ensures a flexible, extensible, and scalable payment processing system following all SOLID principles.**
