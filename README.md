## **ðŸ”¹ Assignment 1: Refactor a Poorly Designed Code (SRP & OCP)**
### **ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement**
The given Java code violates **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** and **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**.  
Refactor the code to:
1. **Separate concerns properly** (SRP)
2. **Make it extensible** for new storage types without modifying the base class (OCP)

### **ðŸ“Œ Files**
- `easy1.java`   Original code violating SOLID principles  â†’ Refactored version following SRP & OCP.

### **ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered**
âœ… **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** â€“ Ensure each class has a single responsibility.  
âœ… **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** â€“ Allow extension without modifying existing code.

## **ðŸ”¹ Assignment 2: Implement Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
### **ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement**
A `Penguin` class extends `Bird`, but `Bird` has a `fly()` method. This **violates LSP** because not all birds can fly.

### **ðŸ“Œ Task**
1. Identify the issue in the hierarchy.
2. Refactor the design to **follow LSP**.
3. Ensure subclasses can replace the base class **without breaking behavior**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Files**
- `easy2.java`
  - **Before Refactoring** â†’ Penguin inherits `fly()`, violating LSP.
  - **After Refactoring** â†’ Introduces `Bird` as an abstract class and `CanFly` interface.

### **ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered**
âœ… **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** â€“ Subclasses must be replaceable without altering system correctness.  
âœ… **Proper Class Hierarchy Design** â€“ Use **abstraction** to define capabilities correctly.

## **ðŸ”¹ Assignment 3: Design a Payment Processing System (SOLID)**
### **ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement**
Create a **scalable and maintainable** payment processing system supporting:
- **Credit Card**
- **PayPal**
- **Google Pay**

### **ðŸ“Œ Requirements**
âœ… **Follow SOLID Principles**  
âœ… Allow adding new payment methods **without modifying existing code**  
âœ… Use **dependency injection** for flexibility  

### **ðŸ“Œ Class Structure**
```plaintext
PaymentService (Interface)
   â”œâ”€â”€ CreditCardPayment (Implements PaymentService)
   â”œâ”€â”€ PayPalPayment (Implements PaymentService)
   â”œâ”€â”€ GooglePayPayment (Implements PaymentService)
PaymentProcessor
PaymentLogger
PaymentServiceManager
Main
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Files**
diffass3.java
Implements all SOLID principles in a payment system.
### **ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered**
```
âœ… Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) â€“ Separate payment processing, logging, and transaction handling.
âœ… Open/Closed Principle (OCP) â€“ Allow new payment methods without modifying existing code.
âœ… Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) â€“ Ensure each payment method behaves correctly as a PaymentService.
âœ… Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) â€“ Keep interfaces minimal and focused.
âœ… Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) â€“ Depend on abstractions (PaymentService), not concrete implementations.
